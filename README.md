# AgentPay Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for the AgentPay protocol: escrow, usage recording, and payment settlement on Stellar.

## Overview

- **escrow** — Records usage and supports settlement logic for machine-to-machine payments.

### Service ownership handover

A service's `ServiceMetadata` carries a `description` and an `owner`. The
current owner (or the admin) can reassign the `owner` via
`transfer_service_ownership(caller, service_id, new_owner)` without touching the
`description`. The call honours the pause gate and emits `owner_chg` for
indexers.
### Service metadata vs. registration

A service's metadata (`description` + `owner`) and its registration flag live in
independent storage slots. `clear_service_metadata` (admin-gated, idempotent)
removes only the metadata; the registration flag and per-(agent, service) usage
history are untouched.
### Admin proposal validation

`propose_admin_transfer` rejects proposing the current admin as the new admin
(panics with `InvalidAdminProposal`). This surfaces no-op handovers as caller
mistakes rather than silently storing a pending entry equal to the active admin.
### Schema version: fresh v2 init vs. legacy v1→v2 migration

`init` stamps the current storage schema version (v2) directly, so a freshly
deployed contract reports `get_schema_version() == 2` without ever running a
migration. A legacy contract deployed before this change carries the implicit v1
default and must call `migrate_v1_to_v2()` to reach v2; calling that migration on
a fresh v2 deploy panics with `MigrationVersionMismatch`.
### Batched usage reads

`get_usage_batch(pairs)` reads the accumulated usage counter for many
`(agent, service_id)` pairs in a single call, returning a `Vec<u32>` in the same
order as the input. It is a pure read: no `require_auth` and no pause gate, so
off-chain dashboards and settlement loops can fan out efficiently. Unknown pairs
return `0` and duplicate pairs yield the same value at each position, matching
`get_usage`. To keep the read loop bounded and the host's storage-read budget
predictable, the batch is capped at `MAX_BATCH_READ` (100) pairs; a request above
the bound panics with `BatchTooLarge`. Callers needing more pairs should page the
requests.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, with `rustfmt`)
- [Stellar Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs) (optional, for deployment)

## Setup for contributors

1. **Clone the repo** (or add remote and pull):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> && cd agentpay-contracts
   ```

2. **Install Rust** (if needed):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup component add rustfmt
   ```

3. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo build
   cargo test
   ```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cargo fmt --all` | Format code |
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Check formatting (CI) |
| `cargo build` | Build |
| `cargo test` | Run tests |

## Documentation

- [Escrow: Build, Test, and Deploy Guide](docs/escrow/build-deploy.md) — build the release WASM, run the test suite, and deploy to testnet with the Stellar/Soroban CLI.

## CI/CD

On push/PR to `main`, GitHub Actions runs:

- Format check (`cargo fmt --all -- --check`)
- Build (`cargo build`)
- Tests (`cargo test`)

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, including the
append-only error-code table, event conventions, and the test/coverage gate.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch.
2. Make changes; ensure `cargo fmt`, `cargo build`, and `cargo test` pass locally.
3. Open a pull request. CI must pass before merge.
